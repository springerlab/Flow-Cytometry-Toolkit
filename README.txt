Flow-Cytometry-Toolkit
======================
Version 20140814

Functions for basic manipulation of flow cytometry data and cell segmentation.

This set of .m files contains MATLAB code for processing flow cytometry data, written by Bo Hua and Jue Wang, with ideas from Yonatan Savir.

There are functions for basic operations such as loading data, manual segmentation, and automated Gaussian-mixture segmentation. The data is formatted into a struct upon loading. All the other functions in the toolkit assume this struct format.
